A British-style coffee cake where **coffee flavour is the main design variable**, not an afterthought.  
Sugar is partially replaced with erythritol and sucralose, and protein is increased using whey while preserving a classic, tender crumb.  
Designed for **excellent flavour first**, improved nutritional profile, and reliable results when stored in the refrigerator.

## Directions

### **Coffee Sponge**

1. Cream **butter, caster sugar, erythritol, and sucralose** on high speed for **5–6 minutes** until pale and aerated.  
2. Add egg yolks **one at a time**, mixing fully after each addition.  
3. Mix in **baking powder and GMS** until evenly dispersed.  
4. With mixer on low, add **half the coffee liquid**, then **half the dry ingredients**; mix just to combine.  
5. Add remaining coffee liquid and dry ingredients; mix **only until homogeneous**.  
6. In a clean bowl, whisk egg whites with **salt** to stiff peaks.  
7. Fold the meringue into the batter **in three additions**, gently preserving volume.  
8. Divide batter evenly between prepared tins (see **Portioning & Storage** for volumes).  
9. Bake at **175–180 °C** for **22–26 minutes**, until internal temperature reaches **96 °C**.  
10. Cool completely before frosting.

### **Coffee Protein Cream**

1. Combine egg whites, erythritol, sucralose, and salt in a heatproof bowl.  
2. Heat over simmering water, stirring continuously, until mixture reaches **85 °C**.  
3. Transfer to mixer and whip on high until stiff, glossy, and cooled to **~32 °C**.  
4. With mixer running, add butter **1 tbsp at a time**, fully emulsifying.  
5. Whisk **brewed coffee or espresso** with the chocolate whey to form a smooth paste.  
6. Add this coffee–protein mixture gradually and whip until fully incorporated and smooth.

### **Assembly**

1. Spread a **thin, even layer** of coffee protein cream over the first sponge.  
2. Place the second sponge on top and frost lightly.  
3. Keep frosting restrained so the **coffee sponge remains the dominant flavour**.

## Portioning & Storage

### Batter yield and volume

- Total raw batter mass: **~960 g**  
- Approximate batter volume (after folding): **~1.3–1.4 L**  

**Per layer (2 layers):**
- Mass: **~480 g**  
- Volume: **~650–700 mL**

### Recommended cake tins

**Round tins (2 layers):**
- 20 cm (8 in) diameter × 4–5 cm height — ideal thickness and even bake  
- 18 cm (7 in) diameter acceptable — slightly taller layers; add ~2–3 min bake time  

**Square tins (single layer):**
- 20 × 20 cm (8 × 8 in): bake **30–35 min**  
- 23 × 23 cm (9 × 9 in): bake **22–25 min**

### Storage

- Refrigerator: **3–4 days**, covered  
- Best served cool or after **20–30 min at room temperature**

## Notes

- Espresso is the reference standard for coffee intensity; brewed coffee may be used, but non-pressurised methods require either acceptance of lower intensity or supplementation with a small amount of instant coffee.
- Chocolate whey is biased toward the cream to avoid cocoa-driven dryness in the sponge.
- GMS improves emulsification and crumb softness, compensating for reduced sugar and added protein.
- Coffee flavour is present in **both sponge and cream** and should read clearly even when the cake is served cold.
- This recipe is optimised for **refrigerated storage**, not freezing.
