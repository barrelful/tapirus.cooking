Chocolate-forward Ninja Creami ice cream built around chocolate whey and cocoa, with no cream.  
Uses xanthan gum and split sweetening (erythritol + high-intensity sweetener) to reduce iciness in a low-fat base.  
Design intent: repeatable high-protein dessert suitable for fat loss, with stable texture after freezing and re-spins.

- ⏲️ Prep time: ~10 min
- 🍳 Cook time: ~0 min
- 🍽️ Servings: 2
- ❄️ Freezer-friendly (freeze base in pint; portion after spinning)

## Ingredients

Base
- 250 g skim milk
- 150 g water
- 30 g chocolate whey protein powder
- 10 g cocoa powder (Dutch-process preferred)
- 25 g erythritol
- High-intensity sweetener (sucralose or stevia), to taste
- 1.0 g xanthan gum
- 1.0 g fine salt
- 2.5 mL vanilla extract (½ tsp)

Optional (flavour depth)
- 2 g instant espresso powder  
  *(or replace **30 g water** with strong coffee)*

## Directions

**Base**
1. Combine the whey protein, cocoa powder, erythritol, xanthan gum, and salt in a bowl.
2. Whisk the dry mix thoroughly to pre-disperse the xanthan and prevent clumps.
3. Add the skim milk, water, and vanilla extract to the Creami pint (or a blender jug).
4. Add the dry mix and blend **30–45 seconds** until fully smooth.
5. Rest **5 minutes** to hydrate the xanthan.
6. Pour into the Creami pint and freeze **12–24 hours** on a level surface.

**Spin**
1. Run “Lite Ice Cream”.
2. If crumbly or powdery, add **15–30 g skim milk** to the centre and run “Re-Spin”.
3. Repeat one additional “Re-Spin” only if needed.

## Portioning & Storage

**Per portion (ready-to-eat):**
- 1 portion = **½ pint**, approximately **235 g** after spinning.

**Storage**
- Best texture: eat immediately after spinning.
- Freezer (after spinning): refreeze in covered containers up to **1 month**; expect firmer texture and plan for a re-spin or brief tempering.

## Notes

- Xanthan gum is used at ~0.2% of mix mass to bind free water and reduce iciness in a low-fat, whey-forward base.
- Pre-mixing xanthan into the dry ingredients avoids clumping and slimy texture.
- Erythritol provides bulk sweetness but freezes firm; pairing with a high-intensity sweetener improves sweetness perception.
- Salt and vanilla reduce cocoa bitterness and mask whey edge.
- If texture is gummy, reduce xanthan by **0.2 g**. If icy or crumbly, increase milk by **30–50 g** (replace equal water).
