## Notes

- Peas are added after blending to preserve colour, texture, and sweetness.
- This soup is intentionally light and volume-forward; protein is supportive, not primary.
- Thickness increases as the soup cools; loosen with hot water when reheating.
- Optional yogurt should be added at serving time to avoid instability during storage.
